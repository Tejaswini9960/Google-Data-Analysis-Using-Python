# Google-Data-Analysis-Using-Python

In this project, I worked on analyzing Google Trends data using Python and the Pytrends library.
The goal was to explore how different keywords are searched globally and visualize the insights.

I implemented the following tasks:

1️⃣ Dynamic Keyword Search
Developed a code where we can change only the keyword and automatically search for multiple terms on Google Trends.

2️⃣ Top 15 Countries Analysis
Identified the top 15 countries where the keyword is searched the most.
Created visual representations (bar charts) for better insights.

3️⃣ World Map Visualization
Plotted a world map showing the countries with the highest search interest for the given keyword.

4️⃣ Time-wise Interest Analysis
Extracted and analyzed the trend of interest over time to understand how the keyword’s popularity has changed in different years.

5️⃣ Keyword Comparison
Compared related keywords (e.g., Cloud Computing, AI, Machine Learning) and plotted graphs to visualize their popularity trends.

Tools & Libraries Used

Python
Pytrends
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Plotly

Outcome

This project provides a clear visualization of global search interest patterns, enabling a data-driven understanding of technology trends across countries and over time.
